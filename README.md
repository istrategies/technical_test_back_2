# Introduction

- An API "SampleAPP" is provided with operations over a simple data model with two entities 1...N.
- The API is structured using a layered architecture.
- The solution has two JSONs included used to seed the entity framework context (works InMemory).
- All the functionalities are defined in the Controllers layer and it uses an ISampleService interface with the definition of all the functionalities to be implemented.

# Requirements

## Generic

These are generic requirements that apply to all the requests in the test:

- No internal id can be retrieved through the API. You will have to find a way to identify the Samples and SubSamples without exposing it's true Id.
- All the requests made to the API should be logged in a disk folder (headers, body and client IP). The folder location must be retrieved from the appsettings.json.

## Implement ISampleService 

Create an implementation of the interface ISampleService with all it's business logic. The Infrastructure layer already provides the entity framework context (filled with data) but you will have to extract the data the way you see fit.

## Validations

The Create and Update functionalities must implement validations of the request:

- Sample Name and Id are mandatory.
- Sample Name has a max length of 32 chars.
- SubSample Id is mandatory.
- SubSample Info has a max length of 128 chars.
- You can implement any other more "business related" validations as you see fit.

These validations must be implemented using FluentValidations.

## GetAllAsync

Apart from the expected logic described in the controller, the number of rows retrieved must be limited based on a configuration key. 
*For example: you can limit a request to the last 1000 rows based on creation date.*

## New Functionality

New endpoint to retrieve the SubSamples and it's Sample data flattened. Additionally:

- The request should allow to filter the results based on a "Sample"."Created" range. 
- The request must implement a pagination. The number of rows per page must come from the request.

Expected response structure:

```JSON
[
    {
        "SampleId": "",
        "SampleName": "",
        "SampleCreated": "",
        "SubSampleId": "",
        "SubSampleInfo": ""
    }
]
```

Implement validations as you see fit.

## Unit Test

Pick one of the functionalities provided by the API and create a unit test to cover it.

# Questions over the API

- Why do you think the dependency injection is implemented in each layer and not only in the Api?

    - Me parece muy útil para tener capas realmente desacopladas, creo que para implementarlo puede ser un poco mas claro de leer.
    Solo hay que tomar en cuenta que puede ser un poco mas de esfuerzo para implementar al inicio del desarrollo.
    Muy favorable también a la hora de cambiar proyectos enteros, al no tener auto gestionadas sus inyecciones de dependencias.

- Do you think there is anything that can be improved in the SamplesController?

    - Creo que estaria bien agregar un mayor control de excepciones.

*These questions can be answered in Spanish*.

# Requirements summary
To help you keep track of it:
- Do not expose any internal Id.
    - Para este punto uso el JsonIgnore al ser una lógica de exclusión muy simple, si hiciera falta una conversión mas compleja usaría automapper o un mapper ad hoc.
- Log every request.
    - Para esto uso Diagnostic.Activity And install Application Insights
- ISampleService implementation.
- Validations Create method.
- Validations Update method.
- Limit to GetAllAsync
- New functionality with flattened data.
    - No comprendo el requerimiento
- Create one unit test.
- Answer the questions
